# MBPQS #
Multi-Blockchain Post-Quantum Signatures (MBPQS) is a hash-based post-quantum secure cryptographic digtal signature scheme specifically designed for multi-chain blockchain systems.
The scheme is designed specifically for private/consortium blockchain where orderers are predefined node, and sign blocks in seperate chains (channels).

## Parameters ##
The parameters for MBPQS are as following:



## References ##
The implementation of WOTS+ (including multi-target resistance from WOTS-T) and parts of the XMSS tree generation, including the corresponding unit tests, are taken from [Go-XMSS-MT] (https://github.com/bwesterb/go-xmssmt) from [Bas Westerbaan](https://bas.westerbaan.name/). # MBPQS #
